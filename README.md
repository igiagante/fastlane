# Replicating the PayPal Fastlane Checkout Flow with Next.js

This guide explains how to set up and replicate the PayPal Fastlane Checkout process in a Next.js application using the `@paypal/react-paypal-js` package. You’ll learn which accounts and credentials are needed, how to configure your project, and how to implement the checkout flow using custom API routes.

---

## 1. Overview

The integration involves the following major parts:

- **Frontend Component:** A React component (`PayPalFastlane`) that renders the PayPal buttons and handles order creation and capture.
- **API Route for Token Generation:** An API route (`/api/get-paypal-token`) that securely obtains a client token from PayPal.
- **API Route for Order Creation:** An API route (`/api/create-paypal-order`) that creates a PayPal order using the provided amount and buyer’s email.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have:

- **PayPal Developer Account:**  
  Create an account at [developer.paypal.com](https://developer.paypal.com) to obtain sandbox API credentials.

- **Sandbox Accounts:**

  - **Business (Merchant) Account:** Used to receive payments.
  - **Personal (Buyer) Account:** Used to simulate a customer making a purchase in the sandbox.

- **API Credentials:**  
  Get your `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_SECRET_KEY` from the PayPal developer dashboard and store them securely (for example, in your Next.js environment variables).

- **Next.js Setup:**  
  A Next.js project with Node.js installed. Install the PayPal React SDK:

  ```bash
  npm install @paypal/react-paypal-js
  ```

## 3. Accounts and Their Roles

Before beginning, ensure you have:

- **Business (Merchant) Account:**

  - **Purpose:** Simulates a customer making a payment.
  - **Usage:** Used on the server side to create and capture orders via the PayPal API.
    **Configuration:** Set up API credentials and webhooks (if required).

- **Personal (Buyer) Account:**
  - **Purpose:** Receives payments.
  - **Usage:** Use this account in the sandbox during testing of the checkout flow.

## 4. Integration Setup with Next.js

- **Environment Variables:**

  - Create a .env.local file (or similar) in your Next.js project root with at least the following keys:

  ```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_sandbox_client_id_here
  PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_sandbox_client_id_here
  PAYPAL_SECRET_KEY=your_sandbox_secret_key_here
  ```

- **API Routes:**
  - Create two custom API routes in your Next.js project:
    - `/api/get-paypal-token` for generating a client token.
    - `/api/create-paypal-order` for creating and capturing an order.
